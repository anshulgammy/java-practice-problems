# java-practice-problems

This repository consititues different Java problems that I tried to solved, may be as part of some interview preparation, or somewhere as part of my learning.
I put them together here, as a repository.

I have tried to put the exact question as javadoc on respective classes that I created for them.

Any improvement to the solutions provided here is appreciated. Please do raise the PR with your solution so that I can have a look.

Thanks!
